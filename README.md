## Project Overview 

The project aims to analyse a Strictly Come dancing dataset to find insights into the judge's scoring, contestants' progress and dance categories.

## Data sources

The data was provided by the London Business Analytics group.

I have provided the dataset and Power BI report in the repository files.


## Tools

- Power BI - Data Cleansing and Data Modelling. 

## Data Preparation 

- Removed duplicates and blank rows.
- Added a custom column to calculate weekly scores.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

1. How did the couples develop over the competition?

2. Which Dances were most frequent?  

3. which dances received the highest scores?

3. How generous were the judges when scoring?


## Results
1. The couples improved as they progressed throughout the weeks as shown by the upward trend of the data. Although their scores increased overall, there were a lot of weekly fluctuations for every couple.

2. The top 3 most frequent dances were the American Smooth, cha-cha-cha and Paso Doble closely followed by the quickstep.

3. The dance category that received the highest score was the show dance with a high average score of 9.67 for 3 of the judges and 9 for the 4th judge.

4. Craig was the harshest judge on average and gave the lowest score to all couples.
Layton and Nikita were the most favoured out of all couples and received the highest scores on average out of all couples. Les and Nancy had the lowest average rating out of all couples.

## Limitations 
- A limitation of the data is the comparison of scores, as contestants leave at different points of the programme some contestants can practice and improve and therefore increase their scores whereas contestants that stayed on the show for a shorter period are unable to improve their scores.
